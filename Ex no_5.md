## DATE: 28-04-2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to calculate the total marks, average, and percentage of marks obtained in seven subjects.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Declare three variable value of type int for marks.
3. Prompt the user to enter a value.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Find total and average.
6. Print the result
7. End 

## Program:
```
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
 int sub1, sub2, sub3, total;
 float average;
 scanf("%d %d %d", &sub1,&sub2,&sub3);
 total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3;
 average = total / 3.0;
 printf("\nTotal : %d\n", total);
 printf("Average : %.2f\n", average);
 return 0;
}
```

## Output:
Case 1:
  Input: 75 80 85
  Total : 240
  Average : 80.00

Case 2:
  Input: 60 70 80
  Total : 210
  Average : 70.00

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.

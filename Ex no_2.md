## DATE:
## AIM:
To write a program to check whether the attendance is PRESENT using simple if statement.

## Algorithm
1. Start.
2. Declare a variable value of type char.
3. Prompt the user to enter a value.
4. Read the value using scanf.
5. Check whether the attendance is PRESENT.
6. If true, print "Present".
7. If false, print " ".
8. End.  

## Program:
```
#include<stdio.h> 
int main()
{
  char p1; 
  scanf("%c", &p1);
  if(p1=='P')
  {
    printf("Present");
  }
  return 0;
}

```

## Output:
Input = P
Output = Present

## Result:
Thus the program was executed and the output was verified successfully.
